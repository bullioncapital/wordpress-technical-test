INSTRUCTION FOR PLUGIN: mutiple-blocks-boilerplate-plugin-tailwind

Do to the percularity of this plugin and separation of concerns, each Block component have been separated into individual folders with their dependencies.

1. First, run "npm install" command to install the "mutiple-blocks-boilerplate-plugin-tailwind" 

2. Next, open each Block component under "/src" dir and run the "npm install" command to install their dependencies.

3. Build each Block component by running the "npm run build" command to install their dependencies.

/* E.g npm run build when in the "hero-block" dir.

4. Grab a coffee and you're done.


Some comments have been made across the code. I'm happy to answer any questions.

Thanks and best regards.
