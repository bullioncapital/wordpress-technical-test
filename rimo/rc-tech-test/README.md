Technical test for Matt

Overall debrief:
It was in interesting test, much more of a heavy lift than I expected, but the extra time was much appreciated. I had an interesting time with the price scanner block, especially that it was a combination of tables and tabs, and pulling in data from an API unfamiliar to me.  The other blocks were quite straightforward to build.

Things of note / improvements / nice to haves:
- Would liked to have delved into the API deeper and try to get more out of it, but so many endpoints were unavailable to me with the basic account. As such the data isn't at all accurate but I'm hoping that will be alright.
- I set up a simple theme called "blank" that's been included in the commit, this is because I didn't want to get bogged down having to consider and circumvent all the default styles that are included in the twentytwenty*** themes.
- I would have liked to have styled the editor as well to accurately represent the front end.
